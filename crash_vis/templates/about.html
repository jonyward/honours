            This website was developed using <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/">Django</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap5</a>.
            The map visualisations were created using public info on all <a href="https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data">road traffic accidents</a> recorded in 2021 in the UK, and was visualised
            using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/folium/">Folium</a> a python library powered by <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a>, using python in a <a href="https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/">Jupytr Notebook</a> and exported as HTML components.<br>
